**This version is to be used with a 240x240 TFT display, driver ST7789 1.54 inches ([like this](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003760323160.html)).** BLK pin does not need to be attached in this case. I do not provide any PCB for this version, so be careful: it requires an additionnal SD breakout board ([like this](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005407671816.html)). Other things are strictly identical to the 128x160 version so you can start from exactly the [same schematic](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/Mitsubishi-M64282FP-dashcam/blob/main/Codes/128x160%20THT%20version/128x160_PCB%20and%20schematic/Main%20PCB/Schematic_Dashboy%20camera_NiMH_2023-05-14.pdf) to make your own PCB.

Beware, the 240x240 TFT display is very tiny and difficult to use without good eyes.
