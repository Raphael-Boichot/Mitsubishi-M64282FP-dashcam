**This version is to be used with a 240x240 TFT display, driver ST7789 1.54 inches ([like this](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003760323160.html)). BLK pin does not need to be attached in this case. I do not provide any PCB for this version, so be careful: it requires an additionnal SD breakout board ([like this](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005407671816.html)).**
